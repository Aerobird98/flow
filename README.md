# flow

A compact web based rich-text editor using [Slate-js](https://docs.slatejs.org/) to produce documents in "standardized" format.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

### `npm run deploy`

After `npm run build` you can deploy your build to [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) with this command.

### `npm run release`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder, just like `npm run build`.<br />
Then deploys it to [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/).
